          Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
          base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and
          often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage,
          anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.),
          which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
          wood-fired oven.The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century
          in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in
          Lazio, on the border with Campania.Raffaele Esposito is often
          considered to be the father of modern pizza.Modern pizza was invented
          in Naples. In 2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European
          Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. In 2017, the art of
          making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of intangible
          cultural heritage.

        <p class="sub_sec_tag small_text">
          A fruit rich diet has always been encouraged in the lifestyle of all
          people. Fruits have ample health benefits; the list is seemingly
          endless. The mentality of the world transitions to a more health
          oriented lifestyle. This is why the demand for fruits has increased
          over a period of years. It is not that fruits were not enjoyed before.
          But with a change in trend of demand, it is seen that people prefer to
          have fruits instead of roti and rice. It is not that the nutrition of
          roti and rice is not important. But the nutritional qualities of
          fruits are worth replacing them over rice and roti.
